# CI manifests

**CAUTION**
these manifests are intended to be used in the CI environment only.
We use manifests because the CI environment must not depend on external tools
to deploy RTE to enable testing, so the options are limited.

To install RTE in your cluster, you should use the [RTE operator](https://github.com/openshift-kni/rte-operator).
